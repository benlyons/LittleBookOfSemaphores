# Little Book Of Semaphores in C#

This repository contains solutions to thread synchronization problems, based on those in the [Little Book of Semaphores](http://greenteapress.com/wp/semaphores) by Allen B. Downey.

The examples in the book are in pseudocode, with some Python/C. I'm rewriting them in C#.
